	<h1>THE BUSINESS OF GOOD FOOD</h1>
	<br />
	<p>When Chipotle opened its first restaurant in 1993, the idea was simple: show that food served fast didn't have to be a “fast-food” experience. Using high-quality raw ingredients, classic cooking techniques, and distinctive interior design, we brought features from the realm of fine dining to the world of quick-service restaurants. </p>
	<br />
	<p>Over 23 years later, our devotion to seeking out the very best ingredients we can--raised with respect for animals, farmers, and the environment--remains at the core of our commitment to Food With Integrity. And as we've grown, our mission has expanded to ensuring that better food is accessible to everyone.</p>
