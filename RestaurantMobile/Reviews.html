	<p>5/5 - Quick dinner options: so my husband suggested trying Chipotle Mexican Grille- 
Which sounded ok with me 

Chicken bowl - My husband said yum 
Chips and Guacamole - My favorite 
Steak bowl - yummy 
Side Queso - we both agree tasty 

Guacamole is my go to so I could it eat    as a side- main dish- topping 

I'd recommend it especially for quick dinner options - it feed us and saved us time - <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/chipotle-mexican-grill-miami-7">Kylie. A</a></p>

<p>5/5 - What can I say 
First it's my daughter favorite place to eat 
Second everything is super good and organic 
I wanted to order the catering and it went wrong 
The manager Adrian was super nice 
Even if it didn't work out for the catering he invited my daughter and her best friend 
It was super nice of him 
We will definitely come back 
A big thank you to Adrian - <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/chipotle-mexican-grill-miami-7">Helene B.</a></p>

<p>5/5/ - I'm somehow here at least 2-3 times a week usually for dinner. Located near the university of Miami, the lines can get pretty long usually between 8PM-8:45 on weekdays. Coming here after practice is a tradition for the table tennis team on most days.

These long lines are worth the abnormal amount of food this location seems to give. The veteran servers are polite but distant enough to keep their cool over the kind of University crowd that occasionally gives them trouble.

The food and quality are as consistent as it gets for this kind of restaurant model. Plenty of tables at this location and outdoor seating. There are two raised bars that seat 6 and a round table, so larger parties should keep that in mind.

The staff are also mindful of return customers and I have received the occasional complementary drink or even a free bowl for continued loyalty to this restaurant. I come back anyway though as you can't find this much satisfactory food at a relatively low price save for cooking on your own!

For those who aren't super picky about hyper authentic Mexican cuisine, you just cannot pass up this location. - <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/chipotle-mexican-grill-miami-7">Justin M.</a></p>

<p>4/5 - This Chipotle is definitely above average for Chipotles. They will always have a special place in my heart. I use to come here friends multiple times per week. They give you the most amount of food out of every Chipotle I've been to. The food is also consistent though they do sometimes run out of a certain ingredient if you come late. The people who work here are also super friendly, polite, and some of them even remember us. One time, when we came right before closing the guy who I'm pretty sure is the manager gave us free chips. Only problem is that the line can get ridiculously long if you come during dinner hours. The line can be over 40 minutes. The place is also pretty clean unless you come during their busy hours. - <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/chipotle-mexican-grill-miami-7">Ji L.</a></p>
